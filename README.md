# MARKET SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

This project shows crypto market analysis using two datasets provided : 
- Crypto Trading Data 
- BTC Market Sentiments

A number of analysis methods were applied on the merged dataset (formed through the join by date for both the datasets)

At first, only the analysis of BTC market with respect to the BTC market sentiments were conducted. Later, a similar analysis was conducted for the whole market (including BTC as well) w.r.t. the BTC market sentiments. Though the magnitude of correlation between the overall crypto market & BTC market sentiment was much weaker than the correlation between the only BTC market and the BTC market sentiments.
